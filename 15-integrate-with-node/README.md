# Transform piped data from bash using a node.js Transform stream

See `filter-ldjson.js` for the example script.

## Additional notes
You can read more about node.js streams (a pretty deep subject) here: https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html

There's some interesting things happening in the `run-test.sh` script that aren't covered in this course. You can read up on those things here:

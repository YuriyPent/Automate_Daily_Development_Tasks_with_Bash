# Use jq and grep to find unused dependencies in a project

See accompanying files.

Fun fact: I used something similar to this at work on a project that has 250+ dependencies ðŸ˜±. Of course, if you really want to do something like this in a robust way, you'd need to do static code analysis. But for something quick and dirty, this works well I think.
